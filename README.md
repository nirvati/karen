# karen

> Escalate to your manager and get root access!

This is an extended fork of the `sudo` and `elevate` crates, which is a simple library to restart your process with sudo to escalate privileges.

This fork is a refactor of the original version, with the following changes:

- A builder pattern for the `Elevate` struct
- An ability to use `pkexec` or `polkit` as an alternative to `sudo` by setting the wrapper from the builder

The API is a superset of the original `sudo` crate, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement, but you can also use the new builder pattern to set your own options (currently only wrapper is supported)

The original `sudo` crate can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dns2utf8/sudo.rs) ([crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sudo)).

[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/karen/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/karen)

Detect if you are running as root, restart self with `sudo` if needed or setup uid zero when running with the SUID flag set.

## Requirements

- Unix-like operating system
- The intended wrapper (sudo, pkexec, polkit) must be installed and in the PATH. The default is `sudo`.
- Linux or Mac OS X tested
  - It should work on \*BSD. You may want to use `doas` instead of `sudo` on OpenBSD using the new builder pattern.

## Example:

First, add karen to your `Cargo.toml`:

```yaml
[dependencies]
karen = "0.6.1"
```

In your `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    karen::escalate_if_needed()?;
    println!("Hello, Root-World!");
    Ok( () )
}
```

If you are using logging based on the [log infrastructure](https://crates.io/crates/log) you will get timestamped and formatted output.

## Passing RUST_BACKTRACE

The crate will automatically keep the setting of `RUST_BACKTRACE` intact if it is set to one of the following values:

- `` <- empty string means no pass-through
- `1` or `true` <- standard trace
- `full` <- full trace

```bash
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --example backtrace
2020-07-05 18:10:31,544 TRACE [karen] Running as User
2020-07-05 18:10:31,544 DEBUG [karen] Escalating privileges
2020-07-05 18:10:31,544 TRACE [karen] relaying RUST_BACKTRACE=full

2020-07-05 18:10:39,238 TRACE [karen] Running as Root
2020-07-05 18:10:39,238 TRACE [karen] already running as Root
2020-07-05 18:10:39,238 INFO  [backtrace] entering failing_function
thread 'main' panicked at 'now you see me fail', examples/backtrace.rs:16:5
```

## Keeping part of the environment

You can keep parts of your environment across the sudo barrier.
This enables more configuration options often used in daemons or cloud environments:

```rust
    // keeping all environment variables starting with "EXAMPLE_" or "CARGO"
    karen::with_env(&["EXAMPLE_", "CARGO"]).expect("sudo failed");
```

**Warning:** This may introduce security problems to your application if untrusted users are able to set these variables.

```bash
$ EXAMPLE_EXEC='$(ls)' EXAMPLE_BTICKS='`ls`' cargo run --example environment
2020-07-07 16:32:11,261 INFO  [environment] ① uid: 1000; euid: 1000;

...

declare -x EXAMPLE_BTICKS="\`ls\`"
declare -x EXAMPLE_EXEC="\$(ls)"
...

[karen] password for user:

2020-07-07 16:32:11,285 TRACE [karen] Running as Root
2020-07-07 16:32:11,285 TRACE [karen] already running as Root
2020-07-07 16:32:11,285 INFO  [environment] ② uid: 0; euid: 0;

...

declare -x EXAMPLE_BTICKS="\`ls\`"
declare -x EXAMPLE_EXEC="\$(ls)"
```

## Run a program with SUID

```bash
$ cargo run --example suid
2020-04-17 15:13:49,450 INFO  [suid] ① uid: 1000; euid: 1000;
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),4(adm),27(sudo)
2020-04-17 15:13:49,453 TRACE [karen] Running as User
2020-04-17 15:13:49,453 DEBUG [karen] Escalating privileges
[karen] password for user:
2020-04-17 15:13:53,529 INFO  [suid] ① uid: 0; euid: 0;
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
2020-04-17 15:13:53,532 TRACE [karen] Running as Root
2020-04-17 15:13:53,532 TRACE [karen] already running as Root
2020-04-17 15:13:53,532 INFO  [suid] ② uid: 0; euid: 0;
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

Then give the file to `root` and add the suid flag.

```bash
$ sudo chown root target/debug/examples/suid
$ sudo chmod 4755 target/debug/examples/suid
```

Now run the program again:

```bash
$ target/debug/examples/suid
2020-04-17 15:14:37,199 INFO  [suid] ① uid: 1000; euid: 0;
uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) euid=0(root) groups=1000(user),4(adm),27(sudo)
2020-04-17 15:14:37,202 TRACE [karen] Running as Suid
2020-04-17 15:14:37,202 TRACE [karen] setuid(0)
2020-04-17 15:14:37,202 INFO  [suid] ② uid: 0; euid: 0;

```
